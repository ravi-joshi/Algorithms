There are various methods of debugging linux kernel and kernel modules.

1. Enable kernel debugging options
	- memory allocation / deallocation related issues - SLUB
	- page allocation and dellocation issues - PAGE
	- spinlock related issues - SPIN_LOCK
	- spinlock sleep related issue - SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	- kernel crash dump - KALLSYMS
	- slower system performance - KENEL_PROFILE

2. Debugging via printing
	- /var/log/messages - if klogd and/or syslogd are running
	- user need to read /proc/kmsg or dmesg - if klogd is not running
	- rate limiting is important

3. Exporting information to /proc software file system

4. Debugging via ioctls or other synonymous methods (such as netlink interface)

5. kernel debugger

6. Debugging by watching

7. Network performance debugging
	- network tools (netstat, ethtool etc)
	- /proc/cpuinfo
	- /proc/interrupts

8. Analyzing kernel crash dumps

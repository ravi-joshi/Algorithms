1. Race conditions could occur on a multi-threaded architecture
2. Race conditions could be severe if multi-threaded applications run on a multi-processor systems
3. Most of the time, the issues would occur around the places where threads accessing a shared resource, such as a global variable.
4. Protecting a global variable with appropriate locking would make sure each thread has exclusive access to the variable and their
operations on the variable are sequential eliminating the catastrophic effects such as crashes.
